Exercise 1.4: File Handling in Python
Learning Goals

Use files to store and retrieve data in Python

Reflection Questions

Why is file storage important when you’re using Python? What would happen if you didn’t store local files?

		- It helps to preserve the data, as well as preserving your ability to read data from the files and write data to them. If you don’t store the local files, you can’t reference the data in them again.

In this Exercise you learned about the pickling process with the pickle.dump() method. What are pickles? In which situations would you choose to use pickles and why? 

		- Pickles convert complex data into a packaged stream of bytes that are written into a binary file. They’re useful in situations where you have to store a bunch of complex data while retaining the structure of said data.

In Python, what function do you use to find out which directory you’re currently in? What if you wanted to change your current working directory?

		- You use the OS module to access files across different directories. `os.getcwd()` is used to find out which directory you’re currently in, while `os.chdir()` is used to change directories.

Imagine you’re working on a Python script and are worried there may be an error in a block of code. How would you approach the situation to prevent the entire script from terminating due to an error?

		- I would use the try-except block.

You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 1! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? Feel free to use these notes to guide your next mentor call. 

		- Yup, it’s going. Learning more about Python with every passing hour. I’m proud that I’m halfway through the first Achievement. I need more practice using Python’s terminal commands, probably. I hate having to look up terminal commands every time I need to use it.
