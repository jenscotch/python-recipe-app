# Recipe App

## Objective 

Build the command line version of a Recipe app, which acts as a precursor to its
web app counterpart.

## User Stories

 - Users should be able to create and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty
parameter that would be automatically calculated by the app.

 - Users should also be able to search for recipes by their ingredients.

## Key Features

 - Create and manage the userâ€™s recipes on a locally hosted MySQL database.
 - Option to search for recipes that contain a set of ingredients specified by the user.
 - Automatically rate each recipe by their difficulty level.
 - Display more details on each recipe if the user prompts it, such as the ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty of the recipe.

### Exercise 1.1

### Exercise 1.2

For the inner recipe structure, I chose to use the Dictionary data type because it's useful for data that needs to be labeled, it's a flexible structure, and it accepts multiple data types. Bonus that the rubric for the Exercise requires a Dictionary data type to be used.
For the outer structure, I chose to use the List data type, because it's easily changed, modified, and appended.
