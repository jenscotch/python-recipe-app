Reflection Questions

Do some research on Django views. In your own words, use an example to explain how Django views work.

		- Django views are functions that take HTTP requests and returns HTTP response. For example, on a typical social media page, you might have a Homepage or Newsfeed page view, a Profile page view, and a Suggestions page view.

Imagine you’re working on a Django web development project, and you anticipate that you’ll have to reuse lots of code in various parts of the project. In this scenario, will you use Django function-based views or class-based views, and why?

		- I would use class-based views because they are pretty much templates that have pre-configured functionality that would help me reuse and extend the code.

 Read Django’s documentation on the Django template language and make some notes on its basics.

		- Django template language is the primary way to generate output from a Django application. It helps define the user-facing layer of the application. You can use it in conjunction with HTML.
