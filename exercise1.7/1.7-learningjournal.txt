Exercise 1.7: Finalizing Your Python Program
Learning Goals

Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper
Build your final command-line Recipe application


Reflection Questions

What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?

		- An Object Relational Mapper is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code. It makes database conversion easier and saves time.

By this point, you’ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What’s something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what’s something about your app that you would change or improve?

		- It went fine. I think I did well with testing the app. If I were to start over, I would add more sections to the recipe, such as an “Instructions” section. 

Imagine you’re at a job interview. You’re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question.

		- I have experience creating a recipe database using Python. It is a command line app that allows users to store recipes into a MySQL database. It helped me to learn more about OOP and functions as they relate to Python. 
 
You’ve finished Achievement 1! Before moving on to Achievement 2, take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far: 
What went well during this Achievement? 

			- Most things.			

What’s something you’re proud of? 

			- I’m proud that I made it through this Achievement in a timely manner.

What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement? 

			- Installing MySQL. 
Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Python skills?

			- Sure. It met the expectations I had for CF. I don’t think it gave me any more confidence in my Python abilities than I already had.

What’s something you want to keep in mind to help you do your best in Achievement 2?

			- That I should consult RealPython.com more instead of what’s written in the exercises.

Well done—you’ve now completed the Learning Journal for Achievement 1. As you’ll have seen, a little metacognition can go a long way!
