Reflection Questions

Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

		- I don’t understand this question. Isn’t Python used for the back end and Django is used for the front end? Django is a framework and Python is a language…why would you be in a position to choose between the two??? Who wrote this question?? AI?????

In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

		- In MVT architecture, the template handles the rendering of the user interface, making it easier to separate the design from the logic. In MVC architecture, however, the view and the controller are tightly coupled, which can make it harder to maintain and modify the user interface.

Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
What do you want to learn about Django? 

			- I don’t know anything about Django, so learning anything would be a win.

What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
			
			- I want to learn Django.

Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

			- Working on getting a job.
